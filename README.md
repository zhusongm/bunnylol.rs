<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

The idea for this project came after learning about `bunny1` and using it at work. I really enjoyed it and thought, "I wonder if I could build my own from scratch?" so this is it!

## Demo

![rusty-bunny demo][product-screenshot]

This is what `rusty-bunny` looks like in action.

### Built With

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow the simple steps under either of the following sections:
- [Manual Setup](#manual-setup) – follow this if you prefer to install all dependencies locally.
- [VSCode Dev Container Setup](#vscode-dev-container-setup) – follow this to run the project in an isolated development environment inside a Docker container, pre-installed with all dependencies.

### Manual Setup

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust installed.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Rocket uses the nightly version of Rust so make sure you use that. If you'd like to only use nightly for this project, you can run this from the root of the project after cloning.

```sh
# from the root of the project
rustup override set nightly
```

#### Installation

1. Clone the rusty-bunny
```sh
git clone https://github.com/fbsamples/rusty-bunny.git
```
2. Make sure you're using nightly
```sh
cargo --version
```
3. Build the project
```sh
cargo build
```
4. Follow the instructions in the [Running](#running) section.

### VSCode Dev Container Setup

#### Prerequisites

This requires VSCode, Docker and the Remote Development extension pack. For more details see [the official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_system-requirements).

#### Spinning Up The Environment

- Follow [the official guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume) to open this repository inside a dev container. VSCode will read the [config file](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) provided to auto-install relevant dependencies and extensions.
- To run terminal commands, use the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) functionality.

### Running

1. Install shuttle and log in (for new containers only)
```sh
cargo install cargo-shuttle
```
```sh
shuttle login
```
2. Run the project
```sh
shuttle run
```
3. Visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)
4. To test a command, go to [localhost:8000/search?cmd=tw](http://localhost:8000/search?cmd=tw) and you should be redirected to Twitter
5. Publish to prod
```sh
shuttle deploy
```
### Testing

Run the following command
```sh
cargo test
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To test out a command, type in http://localhost:8000/search?cmd= followed by your command.

The following commands are supported by `rusty-bunny`:
- "tw" -> redirects to twitter.com
- "tw @username" -> redirects to twitter.com/username
- "gh" -> redirects to github.com
- "gh username" -> redirects to github.com/username
- "gh username/repo" -> redirects to github.com/username/repo

Everything else redirects to a google search with your query.
